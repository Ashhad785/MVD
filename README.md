Abstract- Traffic monitoring has emerged as an essential research area for improved traffic management on account of the surging population of urban cities. Acoustic traffic monitoring (ATM) has emerged to be a cost-effective and efficient alternative to more computationally expensive methods of monitoring traffic such as those involving computer vision technologies. In this paper we present MVD and MVDA: two open datasets for the development of acoustic traffic monitoring and  moving vehicle sub-type classification algorithms, which contains audio recordings of moving vehicles. The dataset contain four classesâ€” Trucks, Cars, Motorbikes and a No-vehicle class. Additionally, we propose a novel and efficient way to classify these acoustic signals with great accuracy using cepstrum and spectrum based local and global audio features, and a multi-input neural network. Experimental results show that our methodology improves upon the established baselines on the IDMT-Traffic and IDMT-Augmented datasets and achieves an accuracy of 91.98% and 96.66% on our MVD and MVDA Datasets respectively. Finally, we deploy the proposed model through an Android application to make it accessible for testing and demonstrate its efficacy.
